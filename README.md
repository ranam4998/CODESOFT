Titanic Survival Prediction This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. This classic beginner project provides valuable insights into data analysis and predictive modeling techniques. Key Features: Dataset: The Titanic dataset includes crucial passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status. Data Exploration: In-depth analysis to understand the relationships between passenger attributes and survival outcomes. Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict survival. Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.

Sales Prediction Using Python This project focuses on forecasting product sales by analyzing various influencing factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. By leveraging machine learning techniques in Python, we aim to predict future sales trends, enabling businesses to optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Key Features: Data Analysis: Comprehensive exploration of sales data to identify key patterns and trends. Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various predictive models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Performance Evaluation: Assessment of model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.

Iris Flower Classification This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. Utilizing the well-known Iris dataset, this classification task demonstrates fundamental concepts in data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Key Features: Dataset: The Iris dataset, containing 150 samples and four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). Models: Multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, are explored. Evaluation: Model performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation techniques. This project serves as a practical introduction to machine learning and data analysis, providing a foundation for understanding classification tasks.
